# compareJars
Compares two JAR files and prints out removed, modified and added classes and their members. Primarily meant to compare two Android JAR and get a human readable diff. 

Have a look at the results of comparing Android API 22 and API 21 [here](https://github.com/JustinAngel/compareJars/blob/master/output.txt).
